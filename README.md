# facebook-comment-search
A Chrome extension that helps you search any comments on a Facebook post

## Privacy Policy
This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any user data to external servers. The only data stored is:
1. User preferences (language selection and comment loading settings) which are saved locally using Chrome's storage API
2. No personal information, comments, or Facebook data is collected or stored
3. All search operations are performed locally within the browser
4. No analytics or tracking mechanisms are implemented
The extension operates entirely within the user's browser and requires minimal permissions only to function on Facebook pages. We have no plans to collect any user data in future versions.
